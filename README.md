# new-mac

The new-mac script is designed to be run before Homebrew or XCode tools are installed. 
Just download the file, run it from anywhere and it should Just Workâ„¢ as long as your name is Evan Bunnage and you have access to all my repos ðŸ™‚ 

It's also written to be run again and again safely (at your own risk).
